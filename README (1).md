# The Union Testnet-9 is live


Union is a ZK interoperability layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. They raised $16M to build the infra for inter blockchain communication. There's been a Testnet-8 but it's not too late to battle test the network before it goes live. Potential drop confirmed.

1. Go to https://app.union.build/ and connect your evm and cosmos wallets
2. Requests tokens from the faucets

3. Open the transfer tab and make a transfer from one network to another

E.g. Union -> Stargaze, Union -> Babylon, etc..

For edge, you want to make transfer across all chains as it will count as achievements on the Union dashboard https://dashboard.union.build/

To max test and not just spam the network, keep a daily streak across all chain routes. Here's mine
- Union -> Babylon -> Union
- Union -> Stargaze -> Union
- Stargaze -> Babylon -> Stargaze
- Union -> Sepolia -> Union
- Union -> Holesky -> Union

(Sepolia and holesky are down now, will update this when transfers are going through again.)

You'll need Babylon and Stargaze tokens to make transfers from them. Request other faucets too
- https://testnet.ping.pub/stargaze/faucet
- Join the [Babylon Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/babylonglobal). Get verified & request on #faucet-test-baby channel (gives 0.3 tBABY per address)
- https://faucet.circle.com/
- https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia
